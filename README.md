This is an application that allows a user to input meals with their ingredients. Users can sort ingredients by their category and also add notes to them (ex. Spaghetti sauce Notes: no sugar). 
After users have their meals set they can go to the "Shopping List" and add all the meals they want for the week. The ingredients needed will populate their list and there is an option to email
this list to you. The email address is prepopulated by your username, but can be changed if you want it sent to a different email. This will email you the ingredients sorted in their categories,
and optional notes if you had opted to add those in.
